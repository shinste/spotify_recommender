# Spotify Song Recommender Application

> Welcome to my Spotify Recommender repository!


## Motivation

Like many others, my music taste changes from time to time. My answer to the question "What kind of music do you listen to" will almost never be the same. My volatile preference for music produces an obstacle for exploring new tracks and artists that fit the current phase I'm in. This is especially true because of Spotify's current recommendation system, which is simply providing recommendations while listening to large playlists and hoping you will like them. The problem with this is there is no support for a listener to actively look for recommendations that cater to that listener's taste at that moment, something like "I want to listen to something like X and Y". This project's main objective was to enable Spotify listeners to easily create those customizable song recommendations based on seed songs/artists.

## Authorization

As you may have predicted, this application requires authorization from the user through Spotify to make Spotify API calls on behalf of the user's account account. The only changes that will be reflected on your account through this application is adding songs to playlists. 

- **IMPORTANT!!!** Because this application is pending approval from Spotify, users who aren't specifically whitelisted cannot access the APIs for their accounts. There is a testing account provided in the Spotify login page for demonstration purpose, but if you would like to personally use this application, please contact me at stephenshin1@hotmail.com so I may whitelist your account.

## Key Features

- **Song Recommendation**: Add up to 5 seed songs/artists that will influence the recommendations given to you.
